#Tiles ->
#Level design by matrices where in each coord specifies the tile present 
    #Ex: [ stone, wood, dirt
    #        stone, dirt, wood  ]

#Implement collisions on a per tile basis? (Can walk through water and floors but not walls)


#Next TODOs: flesh out main menu buttons, level editor/tiles, actual game objective (Ex: collecting items), sprites/animations
